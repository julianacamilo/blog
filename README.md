## Requisitos do projeto

Introduction
Thinking about a project that has a list of "Posts," each containing an image, title, and 
a brief description. Each post needs to have a list of comments that users have left 
when entering that specific post.
The challenge consists of:
• Create an "Posts" initial page with a list of posts, where each post should have 
a link to a second screen called "Post Details."
• Create a "Post Details" screen that should contain the post details, related 
comments with the user's email, and a link to return to the previous screen.
In a data.ts (TypeScript) file, create a list of posts with the following information:
List of posts with:
• id - number
• title - text
• imageUrl - text
• body – text
List of comments with:
• id - number
• postId - number
• email - text
• body – text
